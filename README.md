# Key Box
A physical password manager, built inside an altoid's tin

## How it will work
The device will have a grid of LEDs, where each LED represents an online account. The user will turn a knob to choice an LED. Once the user has selected the proper account, the user will place an NFC tag against a reader, and the correct password will be sent from the password manager to a connected computer. 

Passwords are generated each time the device is used, based on the unique data on the user's NFC tag. This means that the user has to lose both the NFC tag, and the device itself, for their passwords to be comprimised. 

After a prototype is made, there are plans to make an accompanying desktop application, to make configuring the device easier.

## What's the current progress?
I keep notes in `src/NOTEPAD.md`

## I have an idea, how can I tell you about it?
Feel free to post an issue.
